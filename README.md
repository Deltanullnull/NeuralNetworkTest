This is a vanilla implementation of a Neural Network. 

This NN consists of two hidden layers of size 3 and 4. The number of layers as well as the size of each layer can be modified within the source code.

Matrix and vector operations are performed with the Eigen library (included inside third_party folder).

This project includes an example program to train/test a neural network on the iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). Please run the train_iris.bat file in order to create a neural network (or test_iris.bat in order to test it).
